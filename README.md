# Tic-Tac-Toe Using MiniMax Algorithm
A Tic-Tac-Toe is a 2 player game, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid.The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

Tic-Tac-Toe.py is the python implementation of the game. 
There are two modes to play:
<ul>
 <li>Single Player (Against Computer)</li>
 <li>2 Players</li>
</ul>

The 2 players mode iteratively takes input from both the players, while making sure, if anyone has won or not.

The single player mode uses MiniMax algorithm to make the computer unbeatable. Even if the player plays the most optimal move everytime, the end result would be atmost a draw.
